# CMP301-Graphics Programming

This is a DirectX11 project that demonstrates the following:

- Global Illumination Path tracing
- User-controllable Gerstner waves using the Domain and Hull shaders to dynamically tessellate near the peaks of the waves
- Terrain generated from a height map in the vertex shader and per pixel normal calculations for lighting
- PostProcessing bloom effect
- Blinn-Phong lighting
- Debug normal rendering using Geometry shader
